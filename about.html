	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	
	<p>My name is Ashley Zrubek and I'm a visual effects and motion graphics student studying at the Art Institute of Austin and have a passion for the graphic arts. My goal is to deliver a message to the viewer that is easy to understand while maintaining the aesthetics of the work to be more pleasing and striking to the eye. I love learning the ins and outs of how something is done while approaching situations from another angle. Creating something that wasn't originally there in the first place is an art form in itself. Brainstorming the design and then transforming it into a piece that's completely original is my specialty. Animation is art in motion, it's exciting and breathes life into the creative world of film and broadcasting while helping to tell a story. I would love to work with you and help your project come to life. Feel free to contact or message me if you would like to collaborate on any project or have any questions.</p>
